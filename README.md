### For reference on application software version:

Application software version refers to a specific release or iteration of a particular software application. Each version typically includes updates, features, fixes, or enhancements compared to previous releases. Versioning helps users and developers identify and manage different releases of the software, ensuring they are using the most current and compatible version for their needs.

It's important to note that version numbering often follows a specific format, such as "_major.minor.patch_" (e.g., 1.2.3), where changes in the major number indicate significant updates, the minor number indicates smaller improvements or features, and the patch number refers to bug fixes.
